Communication is done through the backend utilizing HTTP/HTTPS APIs and data exchanges, enabling authentication, post creation, and retrieval. Login sessions should enforce authenticated access, while the database stores sensitive information such as user credentials, session details, and blog content. These assets collectively enable the blogâ€™s functionality and represent critical points requiring security protections.",
